# Interactive Visualization

Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning as explored in the readings. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

This project builds a couple of basic Shiny Apps with interactive visualization of some mid-term test data

## installations and setup
Go to the [Shiny Apps hosting service](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and set up an account. Transfer your visualization to the RStudio servers according to the instructions [here](http://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/).


Step-by-step instructions for building a Shiny App

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```



## usages 

* Be familiar with the ways that data visualization can aid student learning
* Understand the structure of a Shiny App
* Be able to build a basic Shiny App to run locally on your machine
* Be able to explore interactive functionality within a Shiny App to convey a message about data
